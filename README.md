# Bank-Failure-Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of bank failures using various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to leverage historical data to assess factors that could indicate potential failures in banks, providing useful insights for stakeholders.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes various features related to financial statements of banks, economic indicators, and other relevant variables. Make sure to review the dataset details for understanding variable definitions and data types.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- TensorFlow

## Model Development
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The data undergoes cleaning to handle missing values, normalization, and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial analyses are performed to visualize relationships among variables and identify key factors influencing bank failure probabilities.
3. **Model Selection**: Several machine learning models are evaluated, including:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - Gradient Boosting

4. **Model Evaluation**: Models are assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
