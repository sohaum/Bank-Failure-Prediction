# Bank Failure Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict bank failures using historical data. The model is built using machine learning techniques to analyze various factors contributing to bank insolvency and to assist in decision-making for stakeholders in the banking sector.

## Project Structure
The repository contains Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, and datasets necessary for the analysis and model training. The key components include:

- **Data**: Raw and processed datasets used for training and evaluation.
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks containing exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model development.
- **Scripts**: Python scripts for data processing, model training, and evaluation metrics.
- **Results**: Visualizations and metrics assessing model performance.

## Machine Learning Models Used
The following machine learning models were implemented in this project:

- **Logistic Regression**: Used for binary classification to predict bank failures.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: An ensemble method that improves prediction accuracy by combining multiple decision trees.
- **Gradient Boosting**: Another ensemble technique that builds models sequentially to improve performance.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Used for classification tasks by finding the optimal hyperplane.
- **Neural Networks**: A deep learning model implemented using TensorFlow for complex pattern recognition.

## Requirements
Make sure you have the following libraries installed to run the notebooks and scripts:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow`
- `statsmodels`
